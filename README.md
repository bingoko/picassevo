Draw pretty pictures by throwing shapes at a canvas until they stick.

This is my own take on Roger Alsing's [EvoLisa](http://rogeralsing.com/2008/12/07/genetic-programming-evolution-of-mona-lisa/).  Unlike the original version I don't bother trying to move points around, or try to change polygon shapes.  I just pick a single primitive and paint as many as possible as fast as I can.

On my machine this runs 2-5x faster if you don't keep the window in the foreground.
